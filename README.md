# CHANEL

## What is the goal ?

The purpose of the test is to create a real-time chat like messenger, Slack or IRC.
The project is react-based and needs to use websocket but for the rest you are free implement it your way.
We really prefer quality over quantity, a small but well implemented and commented code rather than a big not working project.
